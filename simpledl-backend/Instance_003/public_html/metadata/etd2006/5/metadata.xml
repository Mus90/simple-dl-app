   <title>Open Access for ETDs</title>
   <description>To set the stage, I describe the kinds of literature most and least suited to open access (OA) and some of the recent policies by universities and funding agencies to mandate OA. Then I argue that ETDs are among the genres most suited to OA, examine the properties of ETDs that make this so, call for universities to mandate OA for ETDs, and discuss some of the policy and implementation questions that such mandates might raise.</description>
