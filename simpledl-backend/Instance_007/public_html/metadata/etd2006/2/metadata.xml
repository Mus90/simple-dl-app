   <description>Projects and initiatives across the country are indicating a significant difficult around the exchange, re-use, and repurposing of learning objects. Learning objects that are being created must meet specific criteria for accessibility, flexibility and clarity around intellectual property - think of this as open &apos;copyright&apos; standards. In many cases, where intellectual property is clear, it is restrictive and/or encumbered beyond reasonable opportunities for exchange, re-use, sale, or repurposing. This workshop will discuss how Creative Commons licensing can facilitate the sharing of learning objects with a view to increasing the availability of Canadian content-rich learning objects.</description>
